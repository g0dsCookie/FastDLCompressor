## Introduction

FastDLCompressor is a tool to create a compressed FastDL directory for Garry's Mod.

## Usage

    fastdlcompressor <source> <target>

- \<source\> is the source directory, that should be compressed
- \<target\> is your FastDL directory, where the compressed files should be stored

**Warning:** The target directory will be deleted before compression!
